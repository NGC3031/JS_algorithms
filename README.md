#JS-basics
Algorithm examples in JavaScrip that I have used for teaching and self learning 
over the years. Use at your own risk. Do not use algorithms if you dont get how
it works or what it is doing. These are just demo algorithms so there might be 
better algorithms for what you are wanting to do.
